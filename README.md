# FaceTouch Recognition App

![App Logo](app_logo.png)

The FaceTouch Recognition App is an application designed to detect and recognize instances when a hand touches the face. The app utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to analyze live video streams or pre-recorded videos and identify instances of hand-to-face contact.

## Features

1. **Real-time Detection:** The app is capable of analyzing video streams in real-time, enabling instantaneous detection of hand-to-face interactions.

2. **Frame Analysis:** Each frame of the video is analyzed independently to identify instances of hand contact with the face. This ensures accurate recognition even in dynamic environments.

3. **Multi-Platform Support:** The app is developed to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. This ensures accessibility and usability across a wide range of devices.

4. **Configurable Sensitivity:** Users have the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the detection algorithm according to their preferences. This flexibility allows for customization based on individual requirements.

5. **Privacy Protection:** The app prioritizes user privacy by processing the video locally on the device. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.
